--- The Graphical Processing Unit T2 allows for 2D Drawing on screen.
---
--- You are able to draw with lines, boxes, text, images & more.
---
--- And through the use of transformation stack and clipping stack, you can more easily create more complex drawings!
---
--- The GPU also implements some signals allowing you to interact with the graphics more easily via keyboard, mouse and even touch.
