--- The FicsIt-Networks GPU T1 allows you to render a character grid onto any kind of screen.
---
--- Each character of this grid can be colored as you want as well as the background of each character.
---
--- You can also change the resolution to up to 150x50 characters.
---
--- The GPU also implements some signals allowing you to interact with the graphics more easily via keyboard, mouse and event touch.
